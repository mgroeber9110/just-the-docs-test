# #FreeGEOS documentation playground

This page gives a design preview of the next update of the FreeGEOS technical documentation,
such as updates to the search function, theme and layout.

Its contents are not necessarily up-to-date with the main project, so they should not be
relied upon for development. For this, please use [the official version](https://bluewaysw.github.io/pcgeos/).
